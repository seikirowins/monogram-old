# monogram

Monogram is a lightweight ODM for MongoDB and Node.js meant to take advantage
of ES2015 and ES2016 concepts like generators, async/await, and observables.
Monogram is based on [mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose),
so if you're already familiar with mongoose, monogram should look familiar.
